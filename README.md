# DermAI - Server Documentation

**DermAI Server** is the backend component of the DermAI application, designed to handle image classification requests for skin conditions using a pre-trained AI model. This server is built using Flask and can process images sent via POST requests, returning predictions based on the provided image.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed in your environment before setting up the DermAI server:

- **Python**: [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Flask**: Install Flask via pip (`pip install flask`)
- **Ngrok**: [Install Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)
- **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Server Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the DermAI server:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone the DermAI server repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/poshan-p/dermai.git
   cd dermai
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**:  
   Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the Server**:  
   Ensure that the server is correctly set up to use the pre-trained AI model. The model file should be placed in the appropriate directory as specified in the project.

4. **Run the Server**:  
   Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   By default, the server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

5. **Expose the Server Using Ngrok**:  
   If you need to access the server remotely, use Ngrok to expose it:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   ```
   Copy the public URL generated by Ngrok (e.g., `https://xxxxxx.ngrok.io`) for use in API requests.

## API Usage

The DermAI server provides an endpoint for making predictions based on images. Here's how to interact with the server:

### POST /predict

- **Endpoint**: `/predict`
- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: This endpoint accepts an image and returns a prediction of the skin condition.

#### Request Format

The POST request should include the image in a multipart form-data format with the key `'image'`.

### Testing the Server

You can test the `/predict` endpoint using tools like `Postman` or `curl` by sending an image file as described above. Ensure that your server is running and accessible via the URL provided by Ngrok if you are testing remotely.

## Conclusion

With the DermAI server set up and running, you can now process images for skin condition classification via the `/predict` endpoint. This server is a critical component of the DermAI application, enabling AI-driven healthcare solutions. If you encounter any issues or need further customization, refer to the project documentation or contact the development team.
